# TopicSCORE
Code for the paper "Using SVD for Topic Modeling" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07016).

The main file is $\textit{TSCOREfunctions.R}$ contains all the R functions needed for running the Topic-SCORE algorithm. Given the word-document-frequency matrix $D$ and the number of topics $K$, use $\texttt{TSCORE(D,K)}$ to obtain the estimated topic matrix and other output.    

We also include the Associated Press (AP) data set and the Statistical Literature Abstracts (SLA) data set analyzed in the paper.
